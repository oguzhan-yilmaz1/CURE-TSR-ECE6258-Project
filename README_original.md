# CURE-TSR

[OLIVES Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ghassanalregib.com/)

The overall goal of this project is to analyze the robustness of data-driven algorithms under diverse challenging conditions where trained models can possibly be depolyed. To achieve this goal, we introduced a large-sacle (>2M images) recognition dataset (CURE-TSR) which is among the most comprehensive dataset with controlled synthetic challenging conditions. Also, this repository contains codes to reproduce the benchmarking result for CNN presented in our NIPS workshop paper. For detailed information, please refer to our paper [CURE-TSR: Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02463).

### Download Dataset
Traffic sign images in the CURE-TSR dataset were cropped from the CURE-TSD dataset, which includes around 1.7 million real-world and simulator images with more than 2 million traffic sign instances. Overall, there is around 2.2 million traffic sign images in the CURE-TSR dataset. Sign types include speed limit, goods vehicles, no overtaking, no stopping, no parking, stop, bicycle, hump, no left, no right, priority to, no entry, yield, and parking.

These information will be kept confidential and will not be released to anybody outside the OLIVES administration team.

### CURE-TSR Results
We benchmark the performance of algorithms in real-world scenarios and analyze the performance variation with respect to challenging conditions. Below figure shows the accuracy of baseline methods with respect to challenge levels for each challenge type. We show that challenging conditions can decrease the performance of baseline methods significantly, especially if these challenging conditions result in loss or misplacement of spatial information.
